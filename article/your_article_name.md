# Introduction

# Methods

## Structure of the network

```{.python}
self.W_in = np.random.randn(self.N, self.Ni)
```

## Learning rule

## Training procedure

# Results

![**Complexity without chaos.** ](figure_1.png)

<!--{#fig:fig1-->

![**Generation and stability of complex spatiotemporal motor patterns.**](figure_2.png)

<!--{#fig:fig2}-->

![**Improved "timing" capacity.**](figure_3.png)

<!--{#fig:fig3}-->


# Conclusion

The reproduction of the model proposed by @Laje2013 was successful. Although the original article is already quite detailed and self-explanatory, the fact that the authors released the original MATLAB code on Pubmed Central allowed to resolve some small ambiguities and speed up the reproduction process.
